# WPILib 
WPILib is the library that allows you to program the robot with Java. It contains 
classes that describe the hardware on the robot. (Motors, sensors, etc.) [You can
find the documentation here.][1]
WPI, the people who make it, have helpfully created a plugin for Eclipse to use
this library. Its repository url is [http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/eclipse/][2].

# Git
Git is a VCS, or Version Control System. It enables multiple people to work on
the same project at the same time. It does this by storing all code in a central
*repository*. When someone wants to change the code, they first *pull* the most
recent version of the code from the repository. They can then *push* back any
changes they made. We are using a website called [GitLab][4] to host our 
repositories. Since you are viewing this file, you are probably on the website
looking at one of our repositories right now.

# Eclipse
Eclipse is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. It provides all the
tools you need to write Java code for the robot. It also has *plugins* which
allow you to easily use WPILib and Git. [Its website is here.][3]

# Codecademy
You might have not written a single line of code in your life, but that's okay!
We have several months to prepare before the competition gets serious. That's
plenty of time to learn Java basics. To help learn Java, we will use a site
called [Codecademy][5].
